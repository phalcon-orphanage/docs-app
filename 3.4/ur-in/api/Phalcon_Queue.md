# Class **Phalcon\Queue\Beanstalk\Job**

<a href="https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/tree/v3.4.0/phalcon/queue/beanstalk/job.zep" class="btn btn-default btn-sm">Source on GitHub</a>

Represents a job in a beanstalk queue


## Methods
public  **getId** ()





public  **getBody** ()





public  **__construct** ([Phalcon\Queue\Beanstalk](/3.4/en/api/Phalcon_Queue_Beanstalk) $queue, *mixed* $id, *mixed* $body)





public  **delete** ()

Removes a job from the server entirely



public  **release** ([*mixed* $priority], [*mixed* $delay])

The release command puts a reserved job back into the ready queue (and marks
its state as "ready") to be run by any client. It is normally used when the job
fails because of a transitory error.



public  **bury** ([*mixed* $priority])

The bury command puts a job into the "buried" state. Buried jobs are put into
a FIFO linked list and will not be touched by the server again until a client
kicks them with the "kick" command.



public  **touch** ()

The `touch` command allows a worker to request more time to work on a job.
This is useful for jobs that potentially take a long time, but you still
want the benefits of a TTR pulling a job away from an unresponsive worker.
A worker may periodically tell the server that it's still alive and processing
a job (e.g. it may do this on `DEADLINE_SOON`). The command postpones the auto
release of a reserved job until TTR seconds from when the command is issued.



public  **kick** ()

Move the job to the ready queue if it is delayed or buried.



public  **stats** ()

Gives statistical information about the specified job if it exists.



public  **__wakeup** ()

Checks if the job has been modified after unserializing the object
